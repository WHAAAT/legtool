This is the Headless Version of the legtool by https://github.com/jpieper/legtool
In order to operate any four legged robot without serial connection/gui, 
I've altered the code so it can be used completely in python/ros

I think there are no exotic dependencies for this repo 

to start the program just start main.py it will generate some servo angles.
The settings for the robot are in leg_control/example_settings.py
